## Overview
This analysis uses PostgreSQL to perform detailed queries on the Netflix dataset. A total of **15 business problems** are explored, covering a wide range of analytical dimensions such as:

- **Content Classification:** Counting Movies vs TV shows, identifying documentaries, longest films

- **Audience Rating Trends:** Finding the most common ratings for each content type

- **Geographic Insights:** Determining top content-producing countries, analyzing India-specific release averages

- **Temporal Trends:** Listing movies by year, identifying content added in the last 5 years

- **Genre & Actor Focus:** Counting items per genre, analyzing appearances by top actors

- **Descriptive Sentiment Categorization:** Classifying content as “Good” or “Bad” using keyword filtering

- **Format Characteristics:** Listing TV shows with more than 5 seasons

## Objectives
The primary objective of this analysis is to examine the Netflix dataset using SQL to uncover meaningful business insights related to content distribution, audience trends, regional production patterns, and catalog characteristics. By addressing 15 carefully designed business questions, this project aims to:

- Understand Netflix’s content composition across movies and TV shows

- Identify trends in ratings, genres, and release patterns

- Evaluate global and regional content contributions (e.g., India)

- Analyze actors, seasons, and content types

- Assess catalog quality based on descriptive keyword patterns

- Enable data-driven recommendations for strategic decision-making

The ultimate goal is to transform raw data into actionable insights that reveal how Netflix structures its content library, how it evolves over time, and where growth opportunities exist.
